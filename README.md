# Deep-Metric-Learning-using-Triplet-Net.

In this repo an eductional notebook is presenting deep metric learning with triplet net.

CNN model was used as the embedding model.
Triplet loss was used for back-probagation step.
Then MNIST and Cifar-10 were used to evaluate the classification accuracy of the model.
